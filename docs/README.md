* [Unique ID](./helpers.md#unique-id) for generating UUIDs
* [DOM node path](./helpers.md#dom-node-path) for returning the xPath for a given DOM element
* [Screen profile](./helpers.md#screen-profile) for generating a set of properties describing the current device screen, like "height", "availHeight", and "orientation"
* [Window profile](./helpers.md#window-profile) for generating a set of properties describing the current window, like "height", "scrollHeight", and "ratio" to screen dimensions
* [Browser profile](./helpers.md#browser-profile) for generating a set of properties describing the current browser, like "useragent", "online" status, and "language", plus [screen](./helpers.md#screen-profile) and [window](./helpers.md#window-profile) profiles

### Debugging

Dev console errors and messages are turned off by default, but can be activated by setting `KeenTracking.debug = true;`. Additionally, you can disable writing events to the API by setting `KeenTracking.enabled = false;`.

```javascript
import KeenTracking from 'keen-tracking';

// Track errors and messages in the dev console
KeenTracking.debug = true;

// Disable event writes to the API
KeenTracking.enabled = false;

const client = new KeenTracking({ /*configure*/ });

// Observe what's happening in each method
client.on('recordEvent', KeenTracking.log);
client.on('recordEvents', KeenTracking.log);
client.on('deferEvent', KeenTracking.log);
client.on('deferEvents', KeenTracking.log);
client.on('recordDeferredEvents', KeenTracking.log);
client.on('extendEvent', KeenTracking.log);
client.on('extendEvents', KeenTracking.log);
```
